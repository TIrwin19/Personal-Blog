# Personal-Blog

## Description

This webpage is a personal blog I made for myself for the Rutgers coding bootcamp. The assignment entailed creating and deploying a simple blog using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to meet a list of criteria. I was taksed with creating a blog that uses a form to collect input from a user and stores itr to local storage in the browser. Once the data is submitted the user will be directd to another page where they will see there thoughts displayed. They can make multiple entries that will display one after another and up to about 5 megabytes worth before there is no storage left. This project really tested my knowledge of Javascript. One of the hardest concepts was how to grad the input data from local storage using JSON and then setting it to a new parent/child element group without erasing the previous entry. This was an awesome project to sink my teeth into and im proud with how it turned out and also at how well I understand what I did.

## Usage

To use the webpage, you can input a Usernams, Title, and whatever is on your mind in the form and watch as your taken to another page where your thoughts are displayed. You can navigate back to the home page by clicking on the "Add Post" button at the top right of the page. There are also multiple clickable links that take you to my Personal Portfolio or my Github. You can even send me a message with the form on the Contact page of my portfolio if you want to say hi. Try it out! To inspect each element, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you can navigate to the Elements tab to check out the HTML or CSS. Also you can click on the Application tab and click the local storage dropdown. Procede to click on the folder that appears and there you will see your thoughts stored in the local storage of your browser on your device.
